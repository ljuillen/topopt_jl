# Topology Optimization in Julia

Code for 2-D topology optimization in Julia (https://julialang.org/).
The code is based on the 88 line Matlab code (<a href="https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/Apps-and-software/Efficient-topology-optimization-in-MATLAB">top88.m</a>) for 2-D topology optimization.
Details of the Matlab implementation are discussed in the paper:
Efficient topology optimization in MATLAB using 88 lines of code, E. Andreassen, A. Clausen, M. Schevenels, B. S. Lazarov and O. Sigmund, Struct Multidisc Optim, Volume 43, Issue 1, p.1 - 16, (2011) .
